</div><br><br>

Instrument Petting Zoo v.2.0 expands upon the original two-day challenge to create a Minimum Viable Product for a Full Stack Application. This version integrates TypeScript, GoogleFirebase, X-State and GraphQL. IPZ is a web-application project that will continue to grow and develop towards a polished product.

# Overview

<br>

> "This project became a dream of mine when I was a college student first assessing incoming beginner band students. My hand was cramped from hours of writing notes on a student's sheet and I yearned to assess students more appropriately without the guilt of writing down a 1 out of 5 on their dream instrument. This thought remained with me into my official career as a band director and the process of assessing incoming beginners had not been improved. Band programs use an outdated system that requires families to register their students through a third-party application, require instrument assessors to use pencil and paper for student scores, and a final checkout process on a band program management application that the director must manually fill in the student's registered information and lastly their assessed scores. With this project, I aim to support hard-working directors by providing a modernized solution to this yearly process and relieving them greatly of the stress of this process. Allowing more time for the excitement and joy of placing a student on their very first band instrument."
